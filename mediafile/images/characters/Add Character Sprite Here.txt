These are just example assets
Feel free to add character sprites

the format is 

name/outfit/images.png

like:

cupa/default/happy.png

The mod as of writing this doesn't have swap outfit feature yet, but just in case and for the sake of future compatibility, add 'default' there, aight?

Changing Resource Pack directory structure will lead to backward incompatibility nightmare

So I rather to have this resource pack to be as flexible as possible for now.
